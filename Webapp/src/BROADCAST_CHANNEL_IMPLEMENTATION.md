# Telegram-Style Broadcast Channel Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a Telegram-inspired broadcast channel system for the Auraloom B2B textile marketplace.

## Architecture

### Data Models

#### 1. BroadcastChannel (The Channel itself)
```typescript
interface BroadcastChannel {
  id: string;
  sellerId: string;
  name: string;               // Channel name in English
  nameBn: string;            // Channel name in Bengali
  description: string;        // Channel description in English
  descriptionBn: string;     // Channel description in Bengali
  avatar: string;            // Channel avatar/logo
  subscribers: string[];     // Array of user IDs subscribed to this channel
  createdAt: number;         // Channel creation timestamp
  isPremiumOnly: boolean;    // Whether only premium buyers can subscribe
  messageCount: number;      // Total number of messages in channel
  pinnedMessageId?: string;  // ID of the pinned message (if any)
  settings: {
    notificationsEnabled: boolean;
    allowComments: boolean;
    showSubscriberCount: boolean;
  };
}
```

#### 2. Broadcast (Individual Messages in Channel)
```typescript
interface Broadcast {
  id: string;
  channelId: string;              // Reference to BroadcastChannel
  sellerId: string;               // Seller who posted the message
  content: string;                // Message content
  image?: string;                 // Optional image attachment
  productId?: string;             // Optional product reference
  timestamp: number;              // Message timestamp
  views: string[];                // Array of user IDs who viewed
  reactions: {                    // Telegram-style reactions
    type: 'like' | 'love' | 'fire' | 'clap' | 'think';
    userId: string;
  }[];
  forwards: number;               // How many times this was forwarded
  isPinned: boolean;              // Whether this message is pinned
  editedAt?: number;              // Last edit timestamp
}
```
